# High-Dimensional Data Analysis and Dimension Reduction Techniques

This repository contains the code, analysis, and final report for my third-year undergraduate dissertation in Mathematics. The project explores several popular dimension reduction techniques applied to high-dimensional data, including:

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
- Kernel PCA (K-PCA)

The goal of this project was to explore the theoretical foundations behind each method whilst demonstrating how they can be applied to real-world data sets. The report also provides a comparative analysis of the techniques exploring their strengths, limitations and where each method performs best.
